#Malloc and free in c
-Here I learnt how to dynamically allocate memory from the heap and to deallocate it when done using it.
-There was some touch on ***.rodata*** as well as *string* command on Linux.

##Project tasks:
0. This function creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specifiec char
0. This function returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.
0. This function concatenates two strings.
0. This function returns a pointer to a 2-dimensional array of integers.
0. This function frees a 2-dimensional grid previously created by the alloc_grid function above.
0. This function concatenates all the commandline arguments received by the program.
0. This function splits a string into words.

**Note:** This is just a first attempt to using markdown syntax... As soon as I learn how, I'll add the links to the files in question.
